## Vehicle Safety System

# Requirements
## Introduction
   As we are human we need to act upon the cause and consequence. A car is a massive machine with around 30 thousand parts and it produces enormous output power. In case of car cause is accelerating a car which increases the speed this is one of the car's important characteristics but the cause may end in both positive and negative ways that is consequence. To monitor the consequences the Console is used. If an error occurs in a car it is really difficult to diagnose where the error occured. On considering the mentioned points it is must to use a console in a car. There are two types of vehicle safety system they are, 
   * crash mitigation system
   * crash avoidance system
   crash mitigation system is used here. A collision avoidance system (CAS), also known as a pre-crash system, forward collision warning system, or collision mitigation system, is an advanced driver-assistance system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision. Here, the sensors like fire sensor, alcohol sensor, parking sensor and ultrasonic sensor. If any other other sensor gets activated the control system shows error message the vehicle stops or slows down.
