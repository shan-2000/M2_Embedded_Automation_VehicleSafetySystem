## Vehicle Safety System

# Requirements
## Introduction
   As we are human we need to act upon the cause and consequence. A car is a massive machine with around 30 thousand parts and it produces enormous output power. In case of cause, car is accelerating which increases the speed. Too much of speed may end up in accident or uncontrollable situation. To monitor the real time performance of the car the Console is used. If an error occurs in a car control system it is tedious process to diagnose where the error occured. On considering the mentioned points it is must to use a console in a car. There are two types of vehicle safety system they are, 
   * crash mitigation system
   * crash avoidance system
   
crash mitigation system is used here. A collision avoidance system (CAS), also known as a pre-crash system, forward collision warning system, or collision mitigation system, is an advanced driver-assistance system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision. Here, the ultrasonic sensor is used to identify the the distance between the driver's car and other car. If the ultrasonic sensor gets activated the control system shows error message then the driver can stop the vehicle or slows down the vehicle.

## Who:

    The people who have car can use this safety system. This system can be employed in the "Driving school" while the students learning to drive the car in real time. 

## What:

    This vehicle safety system alerts the driver by giving both light and sound signal if any other obstacles comes near to the car. The alerting radius of the car can be modifiable.

## When:

    This system can be used when there is a need to follow more safety.

## Where:

    This system can be used in school areas and in campus for extra safety.

## How:

    This system can be implemented in every car by fixing the ultrasonic sensors around the car and monitor the sensor boundary. If the boundary gets distrubed the. The system will give alert.
